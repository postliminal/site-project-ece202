# Everything that we weren't able to do we can include it here nicely and explain what went wrong

- branches we didn't get to combine
  - multitask
  - wakework recog task

- any future config changes
  - the sweeps
  - or other sweeps

- any processing that could improve results

# include timeline? list of tasks?

# automation of parameters 
- could be directly applied to neural architecture search of future models that use peripherals?
- would have to find/surface obsucre configs and macros
  - then automate script that replaces text, calls gcc compiles, then launches data collection w/ hardware in the loop.
