### Objective & Motivation

Indoors localization has been an interesting problem, since GPS communications can't get indoors and therefore, localization systems have to rely on other techniques.
Multiple solutions have arised including: localization via audio signals, via Bluetooth, via radio 802.15.4. Seeing how the Arduino Nano BLE Sense has all of these sensors,
we are seeking to implement findings of localization research, compare approaches, find out if sensors can be combined. Lastly we seek to parametrize sensing properties of our
system and run experiments on the effects on localization accuracy.

### Initial Design

- Computer UI?
- Video + Documentation

### Experiments & Results

- Zephyr OS / Mbed OS / FreeRTOS?
- Signal Processing params:
  - Sampling and quantization
  - Windowing and filtering

### Timeline

Gantt Chart goes here
